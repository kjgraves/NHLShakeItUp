    "Now, let's scrape data from https://www.hockey-reference.com for each individual game. The syntax for each game in the url looks to be ``https://www.hockey-reference.com/boxscores/YYYYMMDDNTeamAbbrev.html``. Where ``YYYYMMDD`` is the date in that form, ``N`` seems to always be 0 (maybe it has to do with the number of games by the home team that day?), and ``TeamName`` is the name of the home team.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, I write a function ``add_stats`` to add all of the stats to a particular position, given a tag of the appropriate player's row (mostly to make things easier to read). Then, I have to account for some names that are not the same between different sites (e.g. Alex Steen vs. Alexander Steen). I do this with a ``check_name`` function Finally, I run the big loop."

    "Apart from fixing some of the names, I have not tried to handle any lineup mistakes. These seem to result from the differences in the lineups in rotogrinders.com vs hockey-reference.com. It looks that rotogrinders seems to make more of the mistakes (e.g. listing players that did not play in the game). To fix this I will use the actual nhl.com/gamecenter data. I didn't use this before because it is very similar to hockey-reference.com and hockey-reference is a MUCH more simple site to scrape. For the nhl.com/stats site, I will have to use a different scraping tool (I am pretty sure there is javascript code used for generating the table that I need). However, the nhl.com/gamecenter data breaks down their table between defensemen and forwards. If there is only one missing/erroneous player per team in each game, we could replace him with the correct one (and assume that any other lines stayed the same).\n",
