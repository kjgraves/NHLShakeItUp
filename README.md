# NHL 'Shake It Up'

The goal of this project is to answer the questions:
1. Does 'shaking up the lines' help an NHL team to win or to generate more scoring
2. When should a team 'shake it up?'
3. What are the important features to determine when a team should 'shake it up?'
4. Do different rules apply in the playoffs?

## What Does 'Shaking it Up' Mean??

Unfortunately, 'shaking it up' is not a well defined term. I haven't researched into it too much, but I would guess that most news stories that discuss a team 'shaking up the lines' refers to at least one of the top two lines changing (probably both).

Further Questions:
* Does it include the defensive pairs?
* What about injuries? Surely teams play worse on average if one of their players on their top two lines is injured. (I will probably have to filter games following injuries out)

## Description of Notebooks

I do all of the work in jupyter notebooks which are uploaded here.

### Scrape NHL Lineups

This notebook shows how I gather the lineups for this project.

## Disclaimer

This is currently a work in progress, and I will update github as I go.
